# STEPS_Example
Example and tutorial scripts for STEPS simulator.

## Content
* `user_manual/source/` contains interactive jupyter notebooks (plus other rst files) that are used to generate the [STEPS official user manual](http://steps.sourceforge.net/manual/manual_index.html).
* `python_scripts/` contains several python scripts showing with more detail STEPS functionalities.
* `publication_models/` contains python scripts implementing STEPS models used for different publications.
* `other_tutorials/` contains tutorial scripts for special events.

## Python APIs
STEPS 3.6 and above support a [new python API](http://steps.sourceforge.net/manual/python_interfaces.html). The original API is still usable without any modification to existing scripts. In this repository, scripts using the original API are inside `API_1` subfolders while their counterparts using the new API are in `API_2` subfolders.

If you find any problem running the examples, please open an issue so that we can look at it in detail.
