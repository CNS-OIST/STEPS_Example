Scripts in simple_model directory can be used to reproduce data for section Reaction-Diffusion Simulation with Simple Model and Geometry.
Scripts in purkinje_model directory can be used to reproduce data for section Large Scale Reaction-Diffusion Simulation with Real-World Model and Geometry.

These scripts require the installation of STEPS 3.0.0 with MPI support, STEPS can be downloaded from steps.sourceforge.net.
