    "# Stochastic Calcium Burst model with GHK currents\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"note\">\n",
    "This chapter is based on the publication \"Anwar H, Hepburn I, Nedelescu H, Chen W, De Schutter E (2013) Stochastic \n",
    "Calcium Mechanisms Cause Dendritic Calcium Spike Variability. The Journal of Neuroscience, 33(40): 15848-15867\". The model \n",
    "file is [StochasticCaburst.py](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Example/blob/master/publication_models/API_2/Anwar_J_Neurosci_2013/StochasticCaburst.py) and should \n",
    "be run within the complete modelling package because it depends on other files such as /extra/constants.py.\n",

    "The simulation script described in this chapter is also available at [STEPS_Example repository](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Example/tree/master/publication_models/API_2/Anwar_J%20Neurosci_2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter builds on previous chapters by simulating a model that includes both a reaction-diffusion component as well as  \n",
    "electrical excitability. As described in [^f1], the two are closely coupled and this model contains ion channels where\n",
    "activation is both voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent. In addition, the calcium ions form an important part of the \n",
    "current across the membrane, further coupling the reaction-diffusion component with the electrical excitability. This \n",
    "chapter introduces an important new object: the GHK Current object, which is described in some detail in section [P-type Calcium channel](#P-type-Calcium-channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "As in previous chapters we will go through the script, looking in some depth at new concepts, but only brief explanations\n",
    "will be offered of things that have been described in previous chapters. \n",
