    "Althouth the `'TetOpSplit'` solver runs simulations in parallel, the mesh is still fully loaded in each of the MPI processes. This can become a limiting factor when larger meshes are used. Since STEPS 4.0, a new solver, `'DistTetOpSplit'` was added to tackle this issue. This solver loads the mesh in a distributed way, meaning that each MPI process only loads the part of the mesh that it will simulate.\n",

    "For more details about the performace of the distributed DistTetOpSplit solver, please check the following paper:\n",

    "## Converting parallel simulations to distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing from the `'TetOpSplit'` parallel solver to the `'DistTetOpSplit'` distributed solver requires a few extra changes to STEPS python scripts.\n",
    "To show these changes, we will use a slightly modified version of the stochastic calcium burst model introduced previously. We will not go through the entire script but we will focus instead on the parts that are relevant to distributed simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script that we will use in this chapter can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Example/tree/master/user_manual/source/API_2/scripts/STEPS_Tutorial_Distributed.py):\n",

    "<img src=\"images/distributed_full_mesh.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The mesh can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Example/tree/master/user_manual/source/API_2/meshes/caburst_dist/CNG_segmented_2.msh) and visualized with [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/).\n",
    "Note that the mesh tetrahedrons are classified and annotated into two components, representing smooth dendrite (orange) and spiny (green) dendrite. These annotations will then be used in STEPS for creating corresponding patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed meshes are created in the python script with `Distmesh`, a different class from the one that was used for parallel simulations (`TetMesh`). In contrast to `TetMesh`, that could load meshes from a variety of file formats, distributed meshes can only be created from meshes saved to the [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) format.\n",
    "However, while `TetMeshes` required an additional partitioning step in the python script, `DistMesh` can automatically be partitioned upon mesh creation:\n",

    "mesh = DistMesh('path/to/mesh_file.msh, scale=1e-6)\n",

    "Although the automatic partitioning is convenient, it can often lead to sub-optimal partitions in which spatially close but disconnected parts of the mesh are grouped in the same partition. As we saw in the [parallel simulations](STEPS_Tutorial_MPI.ipynb) chapter, it is better to pre-partition meshes with dedicated partitioning software like [Metis](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview) in these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will thus pre-partition the mesh from the [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) software and save each partition to a separate file. Once the mesh is loaded in Gmsh, it can be partitioned with Modules $\\rightarrow$ Mesh $\\rightarrow$ Partition, which opens the following dialog:\n",

    "\n",
    "Each MPI rank loads the part of the mesh that corresponds to its partition. The elements (tetrahedrons, triangles, vertices) can then be refered to by two types of indices: a **global** index that uniquely identifies the element accross all MPI ranks; and a **local** index that is specific to each MPI rank. The following schematic shows a mesh split in two partitions along with the global (top part) and local (bottom part) indices of elements. For simplicity, we represent triangles intead of tetrahedrons but the same ideas apply to tetrahedral meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/distributed_partition_schematic.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The green tetrahedrons are owned by rank 0 and the blue tetrahedrons by rank 1. The thicker red line represents the boundary between the two partitions. Note that in addition to the elements that are owned by an MPI rank (represented in darker colors and solid borders), each MPI rank also contains a shell of non-owned (or \"ghost\") elements (represented in lighter colors and dashed borders) at the partition boundary. These non-owned elements are connected to owned elements but are owned by a different MPI rank. These non-owned elements are required for synchronizing diffusion events across partition boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen on the schematic, the global and local indices are in general different and it is thus important to keep track of whether a list of elements contains indices that are global or local to the MPI rank. By default, to ensure compatibility with code written for non-distributed `TetMesh` meshes, all lists are created as global lists. We can thus create the `GlobalLst` list that is represented on the top part of the schematic (solid yellow borders) with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh:\n",
    "    GlobalLst = TetList([45, 40, 46, 52, 38, 37])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The indices that we give are the global element indices, and both rank 0 and rank 1 hold the same list that refers to the same elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify that a list is created from local indices, all lists of elements can be given an additional `local` keyword parameter. So we can declare the `LocalLst` list that is represented on the bottom part of the schematic (solid pink borders) with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh:\n",
    "    LocalLst = TetList([0, 1, 2, 3], local=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that although both ranks execute the same code and display the same value of `LocalLst.indices`, the list refers to different mesh elements in rank 0 and rank 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Local / global conversions\n",

    "Although the local and global indices of some elements (like `localLst` in rank 1 here) can be identical, global and local indices are in general different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting a local list to global is always guaranteed to return a list that has the same number of elements. However, the reverse conversion from global to local, done with e.g. `GlobalLst.toLocal()`, will discard the elements that are not owned by the MPI rank in which the conversion occurs. The corresponding local lists are shown in the bottom part of the schematic (solid orange border).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `toLocal` method is given an `owned=False` keyword parameter, the returned list will also include elements that are local to the MPI rank but which are not owned by it. These lists are represented with dashed brown borders on the schematic.\n",

In that case, non-owned elements are necessary so that each MPI rank can know whether diffusion can occur to the elements in other MPI ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `toLocal` method can change the number of elements in the list, when the elements are shared across several MPI ranks, we cannot recover the original global list by calling `toGlobal`. `GlobalLst.toLocal()` basically distributes its elements to the MPI ranks that owned them. We can however recover the original list with the [combineWithOperator](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.RefList.combineWithOperator) method:\n",

    "Calling the `combineWithOperator` method allows us to recover the original global list. This method takes a binary operator that should combine two lists into a merged list, this operator gets repeatedly applied to create the merged list.\n",
    "Any function that takes two global lists and returns a global list can be given to `combineWithOperator` but most of the time, it is easier to use one of the binary operator functions in the [operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) python package. Here we use `operator.or_`, which corresponds to the `|` operator that we would normally use to combine lists (see the [corresponding chapter](STEPS_Tutorial_Diffusion.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine whether a given element list is local, one can call the [isLocal](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.RefList.isLocal) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the mesh locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Element lists that are directly accessed through the mesh or its components (compartments, patches, membranes, etc.) are global lists by default. To avoid the MPI synchronization necessary to obtain these global lists, it is possible to use the [asLocal](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.DistMesh.asLocal) method with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal():\n",
    "    localTets = mesh.tets\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we are in the `with mesh.asLocal():` block, mesh properties will be local by default. The same thing applies to mesh components like compartments, etc. Note that `with mesh.asLocal():` does not change whether lists created in the block will be global or local, the `local` keyword argument should still be provided to all lists that are explicitely created, and global lists can still be used in a `with mesh.asLocal():` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for `toLocal`, the `asLocal` method can take an `owned` keyword argument that defaults to `True` so the above code only considers owned elements. To consider non-owned elements as well, one would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):\n",
    "    allLocalTets = mesh.tets\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually not needed, except when declaring compartments or patches from lists of local elements. As we saw earlier, non-owned elements are necessary for diffusion and since diffusions operate within compartments / patches, each MPI rank needs to know whether its non-owned elements are part of the same compartment / patch as its owned elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when using distributed meshes, it is advisable to use `with mesh.asGlobal():` instead of `with mesh:`. They have the same effect since the mesh is in global mode by default, but the former makes it clearer which parts of the code use the mesh globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical group tags\n",
    "\n",
    "The gmsh file format allows the creation of [physical group](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Elementary-entities-vs-physical-groups) tags in the mesh file. Physical groups have a unique integer identifier in the mesh but can also be given a name. The mesh that we use in this chapter has two physical groups: `spiny` and `smooth` corresponding respectively to tetrahedrons from the spiny dendrites and to tetrahedrons of the smooth dendrites (displayed in green and orange earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a STEPS script, we can get a list of elements that are tagged with e.g.:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh:\n",
    "    smoothTets = mesh.tetGroups['smooth']\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we saw in the previous section, this would return a global list of all tetrahedrons that are tagged with the 'smooth' tag. If we want only the local tetrahedrons (including non-owned tetrahedrons) we would use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):\n",
    "    smoothTets = mesh.tetGroups['smooth']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three `DistMesh` properties that allow access to tagged elements:\n",
    "- [tetGroups](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.DistMesh.tetGroups) that gives access to tagged tetrahedrons\n",
    "- [triGroups](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.DistMesh.triGroups) that gives access to tagged triangles\n",
    "- [vertGroups](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.DistMesh.vertGroups) that gives access to tagged vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not use `triGroups` or `vertGroups` in this chapter but they work in the same way as `tetGroups`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating compartments and patches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compartments\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our main example, we first create the `cyto` compartment. This compartment will contain all the tetrahedrons in the mesh and will thus be created from the `mesh.tets` list. We could declare it as we would in a parallel simulation, using global indices:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh:\n",
    "    cyto = Compartment.Create(mesh.tets, vsys)\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The issue with this code, however, is that all MPI ranks will hold `mesh.tets`, the full list of tetrahedrons in the whole mesh. Since the goal of a distributed simulation is to have each MPI rank only consider tetrahedrons that are in its partition, it is preferable to create the compartment from lists of local tetrahedrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus use the `mesh.asLocal(owned=False)` syntax we saw in the previous section:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):\n",
    "    cyto = Compartment.Create(mesh.tets, vsys)\n",
    "    cyto.Conductivity = 1 / Ra\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are in a `with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):` block, `mesh.tets` returns a local list incuding non-owned elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `'Tetexact'` and `'TetOpSplit'` solvers, the volume **resistivity** `Ra` (in Ohm.m) is set for the membrane object **after** simulation creation (by calling e.g. `sim.membrane.VolRes = Ra`, see [the calcium burst chapter](STEPS_Tutorial_CaBurst.ipynb#Initialization)). The `'DistTetOpSplit'` distributed solver instead requires setting the volume **conductivity** (in S/m) of compartments **before** the simulation. We thus set the [Conductivity](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.Compartment.Conductivity) property to the reciprocal of the resistivity `Ra`. Note that we could also give the `conductivity` keyword argument upon creation of the compartment: `cyto = Compartment.Create(mesh.tets, vsys, conductivity=1 / Ra)`.\n",
    "If the keyword argument is not supplied and the `Conductivity` property not set, its value defaults to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patches\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create two patches that correspond to the spiny and smooth parts of the mesh surface. Since the tags in the mesh files are associated with tetrahedrons and not triangles, we first need to get the local lists of `'spiny'` and `'smooth'` tetrahedrons. We then compute the surface of these local lists and intersect it with the surface of the mesh:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    smoothTets = mesh.tetGroups['smooth']\n",
    "    spinyTets = mesh.tetGroups['spiny']\n",
    "\n",
    "    smooth = Patch.Create(smoothTets.surface & mesh.surface, cyto, None, ssys)\n",
    "    spiny = Patch.Create(spinyTets.surface & mesh.surface, cyto, None, ssys)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The patch creation is exactly the same as for `'Tetexact'` or `'TetOpSplit'` simulations, we provide the list of elements (here a local list that also includes non-owned elements), the inner compartment (`cyto`), the outer compartment (which is absent here) and the associated surface system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The local list of triangles that is given is obtained by first computing the surface of the list of local tetrahedrons (in red and purple in the figure below) with e.g. `smoothTets.surface` (see the documentation of the [surface](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.TetList.surface) property). We then compute the intersection between this surface and the surface of the mesh to get rid of the internal surface that corresponds to the partition boundaries (the red part). The resulting surface is represented in purple in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/distributed_patch_creation.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct creation from physical group tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we do not do it in our main example, it is also possible to create a compartment or patch directly from a physical group tag. For example, if all tetrahedrons in our mesh were tagged with the `'cyto'` physical group tag, we could have created the `cyto` compartment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh:\n",
    "    cyto = Compartment.Create(vsys)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, we do not need to supply a list of tetrahedrons so we also do not need to use `mesh.asLocal(owned=False):`. The same thing could have been done for the patches if the mesh contained `smooth` and `spiny` tags for triangles instead of tetrahedrons. We could then directly create the patches like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh:\n",
    "    smooth = Patch.Create(cyto, None, ssys)\n",
    "    spiny = Patch.Create(cyto, None, ssys)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Membranes\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we create the smooth and spiny membranes with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    memb_smooth = Membrane.Create([smooth], capacitance=memb_capac_proximal)\n",
    "    memb_spiny = Membrane.Create([spiny], capacitance=memb_capac_spiny)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in contrast with membrane creation for the `TetOpSplit` solver, we need to create one membrane per patch and give the membrane capacitance before the simulation. Alternatively, we could have set the membrane capacitance with the [Capacitance](API_geom.rst#steps.API_2.geom.Membrane.Capacitance) property:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal(owned=False):\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    memb_smooth = Membrane.Create([smooth])\n",
    "    memb_spiny = Membrane.Create([spiny])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    memb_smooth.Capacitance = memb_capac_proximal\n",
    "    memb_spiny.Capacitance = memb_capac_spiny\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentionned before, we will use the distributed `'DistTetOpSplit'` solver, so the simulation object is created like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "###########################################################\n",
    "# Simulation\n",
    "###########################################################\n",

    "    searchMethod=NextEventSearchMethod.GIBSON_BRUCK\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference from `'Tetexact'` or `'TetOpSplit'` is that we do not need to provide the Efield flag that determines whether membrane potential should be computed (see [corresponding chapter](STEPS_Tutorial_Efield.ipynb#Simulation-and-data-saving); and we do not need to provide a partition object (see [corresponding chapter](STEPS_Tutorial_MPI.ipynb#Using-parallel-solvers). In addition, we set the `searchMethod` keyword argument to the [Gibson Bruck](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=M.+A.+Gibson&author=J.+Bruck+&publication_year=2000&title=Efficient+exact+stochastic+simulation+of+chemical+systems+with+many+species+and+many+channels&journal=J.+Phys.+Chem.+A&volume=9&pages=104) method. \n",
    "Although a different [direct](API_sim.rst#steps.API_2.sim.NextEventSearchMethod.DIRECT) method is also implemented, we currently recommend to always explicitely use the Gibson Bruck method when using `'DistTetOpSplit'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data saving\n",
    "\n",
    "We then declare the data that should be saved:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mesh.asLocal():\n",
    "    Pots = rs.VERTS(mesh.surface.verts).V\n",
    "    CaConc = rs.TETS().Ca.Conc\n",
    "    Currents = rs.TRIS(mesh.surface).OC_CaP.I\n",
    "\n",
    "sim.toSave(Pots, CaConc, Currents, dt=DT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using a distributed solver, the data to be saved should also preferentially be local to avoid the creation of global element lists. We thus declare the result selectors inside a `with mesh.asLocal():` block so that `mesh.surface.verts` and `mesh.surface` return local lists of elements.\n",
    "We save the membrane potential over all mesh surface vertices, the calcium concentration in all tetrahedrons, and the calcium GHK currents over all surface triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the `XDMFHandler` database class that we introduced in a [previous chapter](STEPS_Tutorial_DataSaving.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with XDMFHandler('DistCaburst') as hdf:\n",
    "    sim.toDB(hdf, 'CaBurstSim')\n",
    "\n",
    "    sim.newRun()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Initial state setting...\n",
    "    # Run loop...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `XDMFHandler` class is necessary to take advantage of distributed data saving. Instead of creating a single HDF5 file along with its associated XDMF file, it will create one HDF5 and XDMF file per MPI rank as well as a global XDMF file that contains references to the partitions' XDMF files:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/distributed_data_saving_schematic.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the simulation in the same way as for parallel simulations:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mpirun -n 256 python3 STEPS_Tutorial_Distributed.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for technical reasons, the number of ranks must be a power of 2. The full simulation is most likely too big to be run on a personnal computer and should instead be run on a computing cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The saved data can be visualized in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) as presented in the [data recording and analysis chapter](STEPS_Tutorial_DataSaving.ipynb) by opening the `CaBurstSim_Run0_Full.xmf` file.\n",
