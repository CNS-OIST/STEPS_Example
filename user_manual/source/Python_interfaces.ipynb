    "# Python interfaces to STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "Since version 3.6, STEPS is shipped with a new, more pythonic interface. In this documentation, we will refer to the original interface as API_1 and to the new one as API_2. Unless mentioned explicitely, we will use API_2 by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compatibility between APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Models that were written using API_1 are still usable without any changes. Users are however encouraged to start using API_2 for new models. It is not advised to try to mix both APIs in a single python script.\n",
    "Until API_1 becomes deprecated, users that want to use API_2 have to explicitely specify it at the beginning of their python scripts (see :doc:`API_2/API_ref`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guides\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapters 3 to 9 introduce STEPS concepts in details through examples:\n",

    "- [Simulating membrane potential](API_2/Interface_Tutorial_5_Efield.ipynb)\n",

    "- [Stochastic Calcium Burst model with GHK currents](API_2/Interface_Tutorial_8_CaBurst.ipynb)\n",

    "Equivalent chapters using API_1 are still available for reference (see [Original STEPS API guides](API_1_guide.rst)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, [API References](API_2/API_ref.rst) provides detailed documentation of STEPS API, documentation relative to API_1 is still available ([API_1 References](API_1/API_ref.rst)).\n",
