    "# Simulating Diffusion in Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation script described in this chapter is available at [STEPS_Example repository](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Example/blob/master/user_manual/source/diffusion.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces how to model and simulate diffusion systems.\n",
    "First we will look at how to describe the diffusive motion of molecules\n",
    "by using object of class [steps.model.Diff](API_1/API_model.rst#steps.API_1.model.Diff), then how to import\n",
    "a tetrahedral mesh by using the [steps.utilities.meshio](API_1/API_utilities_meshio.rst) methods\n",
    "and finally how to create a [steps.solver.Tetexact](API_1/API_solver.rst#steps.API_1.solver.Tetexact) object to be used for\n",
    "the simulation itself. The `Tetexact` solver builds on the `Wmdirect` solver\n",
    "(we have used up until now) extended for diffusive fluxes between tetrahedral\n",
    "elements in a mesh. Each individual tetrahedron behaves like a well-mixed\n",
    "compartment where reactions can take place. Diffusive flux between\n",
    "tetrahedral elements is represented by a series of first-order reactions\n",
    "with rate constants derived from the local geometry and the diffusion\n",
    "constant parameter. Thus, this solver object can be used to simulate\n",
    "full reaction-diffusion systems in complex geometries, but in this introduction\n",
    "we will start with a simple diffusion system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to simulate diffusion of one molecular species from a point source\n",
    "in an infinite volume, a problem chosen for simplicity and with a known analytical\n",
    "solution we can compare to our STEPS simulation results. As the volume in STEPS\n",
    "must of course be finite we will create a large spherical mesh, inject our\n",
    "molecules into the central tetrahedron (as there is no concept of a point\n",
    "source in STEPS) and compare our results to the analytical solution up to a\n",
    "time when there are zero or an insignificant number of boundary events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare our mean results in STEPS to an analytical solution we must solve\n",
    "the diffusion equation for one spatial dimension, the radial distance from the\n",
    "point source. The problem is simplified to one dimension because the symmetry\n",
    "of the problem dictates that, in the deterministic limit, the concentration at any given radial distance r\n",
    "from the point source will be equal at all points in space forming a\n",
    "two-dimensional “shell” at that *r*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all molecules exist at a single point at time 0, within an infinite boundary,\n",
    "the analytical solution is (see e.g. Crank, J. (1975) The Mathematics of Diffusion.\n",
    "Oxford: Clarendon Press):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C(r,t)=\\frac{N}{8(\\pi Dt)^{3/2}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{-r^{2}}{4Dt}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where *C* is the concentration (if length units are meters the units of C are number of molecules/ $m^{\\text{3}}$)\n",
    "at radial distance *r*  from source at time *t*, *N* is the total number of injected\n",
    "molecules and *D* is the diffusion constant (in units $m^{\\text{2}}/s$) .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organisation of code\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up our model and run our simulation we will create a Python script,\n",
    "organising the script according to a certain template chosen for a good\n",
    "organisation of our workflow. However, for clarity, in these examples we\n",

    "chapters we will go through the code step by step and look at the statements in\n",
    "detail as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is to write statements to import all our steps packages\n",
    "with all the methods available to describe our model and run our simulation.\n",
    "We will also import other packages we require at this point in the script,\n",
    "such as `math`, `numpy`, `pylab` and `random`. We will make use of the `random` package\n",
    "to help with selecting tetrahedrons from our mesh to sample (which we look at\n",
    "in detail later) and `math` contains many useful basic mathematical functions we'll use\n",
    "for finding the analytical solution:\n"

    "### Simulation with TetOpSplit\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2.3 and later of STEPS include an approximate spatial stochastic solver called `TetOpSplit` ([steps.mpi.solver.TetOpSplit](API_1/API_mpisolver.rst#steps.API_1.mpi.solver.TetOpSplit)). This solver applies an approximation for diffusion whereas reactions are solved by the SSA. The solver is designed to approximate the exact solver, `Tetexact`, to high accuracy and may perform significantly faster then Tetexact for some models. A full description of the method is available at: [http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03126](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03126). Although the method differs significantly from the exact stochastic solver, usage is very similar with only one different command necessary in this example to simulate the model with `TetOpSplit` instead of `Tetexact`. That is, instead of creating a Tetexact solver object we create a TetOpSplit solver object with the following command:\n"
