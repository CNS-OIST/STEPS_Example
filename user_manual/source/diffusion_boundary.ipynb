    "# Diffusion Boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation script described in this chapter is available at [STEPS_Example repository](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Example/blob/master/user_manual/source/diffusion_boundary.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some systems it may be a convenient simulation feature to be able to localize certain chemical species in one particular region of a volume without diffusion to neighboring regions even if they are not separated by a physical boundary. For example, in some biological systems certain proteins may exist only in local regions and though the structural features are simplified in a model the proteins are assumed to diffuse in a local region to meet and react with each other. So it is sometimes important to restrict the diffusional space of some proteins and not the others from a biologically feasible perspective. Similarly, it may be convenient to separate a large simulation volume into a number of compartments that are not physically separated by a membrane and so are connected to other compartments by chemical diffusion. Such an approach allows for different biochemical behavior in different regions of the volume to be specified and may simplify simulation initialization and data recording considerably. In this brief chapter we'll introduce an object termed the “Diffusion Boundary“ ([steps.geom.DiffBoundary](API_geom.rst#steps.geom.DiffBoundary)) which allows for this important simulation convenience: optional chemical diffusion between connected mesh compartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Diffusion Boundary of course can only be added to a mesh-based (i.e. not a well-mixed) simulation and is described by a collection of triangles. These triangles must form some or all of the connection between two (and only two) compartments, and none of the triangles may already be described as part of a “Patch“ ([steps.geom.TmPatch](API_geom.rst#steps.geom.TmPatch)). It is not possible for two compartments to be connected in the same area by a Patch and a Diffusion Boundary since a Patch is intended to model a membrane and a Diffusion Boundary is just some internal area within a volume that may block diffusion, and it would be unrealistic to allow surface reactions and free diffusion to occur in the same area. Once a Diffusion Boundary is in place the modeler may specify which chemical species (if any) may freely diffuse through the boundary. Diffusion boundaries are currently supported in solvers [steps.solver.Tetexact](API_solver.rst#steps.solver.Tetexact) and [steps.mpi.solver.TetOpSplit](API_mpi.rst#steps.mpi.solver.TetOpSplit), but for this chapter we will only demonstrate usage in Tetexact. For approximate MPI simulations with TetOpSplit please see later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example we'll set up a simple system to introduce the [steps.geom.DiffBoundary](API_geom.rst#steps.geom.DiffBoundary) object and expand on our mesh manipulation in previous chapters through STEPS methods provided in the Python interface. The simple examples here may of course be expanded and built on for more complex mesh manipulations in detailed, realistic simulations, though greater complexity is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n",

From creating our mesh (or finding out through methods `getBoundMax` and `getBoundMin` on our [steps.geom.Tetmesh](API_geom.rst#steps.geom.Tetmesh) object) we know that our boundaries are at z = -5 microns and +5 microns. To find the tetrahedrons at the centre points of the two boundaries (i.e. at x=0 and y=0) we use [steps.geom.Tetmesh](API_geom.rst#steps.geom.Tetmesh) method `findTetByPoint`, which will return the index of the tetrahedron that encompasses any point given in 3D cartesian coordinates as a Python sequence.

    "Now for the main focus of this chapter, which is to allow diffusion between the compartments joined by a Diffusion Boundary. During our geometry construction we already created our [steps.geom.DiffBoundary](API_geom.rst#steps.geom.DiffBoundary) object (named rather unimaginatively 'diffb') which will be included in the simulation, with the default behaviour to block diffusion between compartment 'A' and 'B' completely for all molecules. We now wish to allow diffusion of species 'Y' through the boundary which we achieve with one simple solver method call. Importantly, we would be unable to activate diffusion through the boundary for species 'X'; this is because 'X' is undefined in compartment 'B' since it does not appear in any reaction or diffusion rules there.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate diffusion through the boundary we call the rather wordy [steps.solver.Tetexact](API_solver.rst#steps.solver.Tetexact) solver method `setDiffBoundaryDiffusionActive` ([steps.solver.Tetexact.setDiffBoundaryDiffusionActive](API_solver.rst#steps.solver.Tetexact.setDiffBoundaryDiffusionActive)), with 3 arguments to the function; the string identifier of the diffusion boundary ('diffb'), the string identifier of the species ('Y') and a bool as to whether diffusion through the boundary is active or not (`True`):\n"

    "Let's assume we want a spatial plot- distance on the z-axis vs concentration- but don't want to plot every tetrahedron individually. In other words we want to split the cylinder into bins with equal width on the z-axis. Then we record counts from a tetrahedron and add it to the bin that the tetrahedron belongs to. We could, of course, have set up structures to record data from bins before and during our simulation, but instead we will use the data that we have recorded in all individual tetrahedrons (in the code above) to read and split into bins for plotting. And that is exactly what is achieved in the following function, which won't contain a detailed step-by-step explanation as it is not strictly STEPS code, but is included for the user to see how such tasks may be achieved. This function does use some structures defined outside of the function, such as `tpnts`, so would have to appear after the previous code in a Python script to work as it is:\n"
