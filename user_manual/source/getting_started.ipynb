    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this document is to get you started quickly with STEPS\n",
    "by working through a number of examples that highlight the various\n",
    "capabilities of this software package. However, before you can do\n",
    "that, you need to have a working copy of STEPS installed on your\n",
    "computer. So we will first explain the requirements of STEPS in terms\n",
    "of third party software and prior knowledge and then how to compile\n",
    "and install on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Image\n",
    "For user who want to quickly try STEPS without compilation from the source code,\n",
    "we provide a prebuilt Docker image of the latest release, which can be accessed via  \n",
    "[https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Docker](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install from source code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum Prerequisites\n",
    "1. C++ compiler supporting c++11 (e.g. gcc 4.8, clang 3.3)\n",
    "2. Either Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 (or more recent)\n",
    "3. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "4. [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n",
    "5. [Cython](http://www.cython.org/)\n",
    "6. BLAS/[OpenBLAS](http://www.openblas.net/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Prerequisites\n",
    "1. To use the parallel SSA solver TetOpSplit: MPI libraries (e.g. [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) )\n",
    "2. To use the parallel EField solver: [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For STEPS Advanced Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**SBML importer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps.utilities.sbml module is a package for importing and running SBML files. This module requires the SBML library [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important when building libSBML to configure the Python API, for example with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ./configure --with-python\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to libSBML documentation for further information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about the SBML module, see [SBML support](sbml_importer.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization toolkit**\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation of  [PyQtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) and\n",
    "[PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) is required for the visualization toolkit, see [Visualization Toolkit](visual.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the use of a number of packages, namely NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib,\n",
    "Python can be made to resemble the Matlab environment for scientific computing\n",
    "rather closely. The NumPy package brings powerful array objects to Python.\n",
    "These array objects will typically rely on an optimized linear algebra package\n",
    "to make the operations on them very fast. SciPy builds on top of NumPy and adds\n",
    "even more functionality for signal processing, numerical integration, etc.\n",
    "Finally, Matplotlib adds a collection of powerful 2D plotting tools to your\n",
    "Python environment, that once again resemble the plotting commands familiar from Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "These add-on packages are in common use among the scientific computing community and\n",
    "it is highly recommended that two of these packages (NumPy and SciPy) are installed\n",
    "on your system. Although one could use STEPS without taking advantage of these packages,\n",
    "we highly recommend you do take the time to get acquainted with them as they will make it\n",
    "easier to run simulations, collect output and perform extra processing on this data. Starting\n",
    "from the very first example we will show how NumPy arrays can be used for these tasks rather\n",
    "than the basic built-in types in Python (lists, tuples etc), although one could replace a NumPy\n",
    "array with a list in the code, for example, if more comfortable with the built-in types.\n",
    "For further information on these packages you can visit the following online resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Documentation Link to NumPy and SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/Documentation)\n",
    "* [NumPy for Matlab users](http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users)\n",
    "* [A very good NumPy tutorial content-wise.](http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/HTML/numdoc.htm)\n",

    "### Obtaining STEPS Source code\n",
    "\n",
    "STEPS 3.0.0 and above are avalalble at [https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Old releases (STEPS 2.2.0 and below) can be downloaded at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/steps/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/steps/files/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install From Github Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how to compile and install STEPS on a generic Unix-alike system, including Linux and MacOSX.\n",
    "Official support of Windows platform is discontinued.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**:  Started from Version 3.0.0, STEPS has adapted CMake for building and installation. To avoid version conflict, we recommend user to remove any previous installation that is below 3.0.0.  _\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the installation location of STEPS in a terminal using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -c \"import steps; print steps.__file__\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python -c \"import steps; print steps.__file__\"\n",
    "    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/steps/__init__.pyc\n",

    "You can now manaully delete the STEPS installation above:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [sudo] rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To **install STEPS from source code**, first clone the repository using the folowing command in terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS.git\n",
    "\n",
    "then run the following commands to compile the source code and install:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd STEPS\n",
    "    git submodule update --init --recursive\n",
    "    mkdir build\n",
    "    cd build\n",
    "    cmake ..\n",
    "    make\n",
    "    [sudo] make install\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the installation location by changing the prefix in CMake:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/MY_INSTALL_LOCATION ..\n",
    "\n",
    "MPI and PETSc libraries are automatically detected in the system. If the user\n",
    "wants to manually choose to build STEPS with / without them it can set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cmake -DUSE_MPI=[True|False] -DUSE_PETSC=[True|False] ..\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to [CMAKE documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for customizing your installation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can check the STEPS installation with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -c \"import steps; steps._greet()\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If STEPS is installed successfully, you should be able to see similar information as below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Just about every task related to building a model, describing the geometry and\n",
    "running a simulation in STEPS involves creating **objects** in Python and utilising\n",
    "the object methods (so it is highly recommend that you are familiar with Python objects\n",
    "and comfortable using them, though you will gain more experience by working through the\n",
    "examples in this document). The class definitions for these objects reside in Python modules\n",
    "in the steps directory ([steps.model](API_model.rst#steps.model), [steps.geom](API_geom.rst#steps.geom), [steps.solver](API_solver.rst#steps.solver) etc).\n",
    "So to test installation,\n",
    "try to create your first STEPS object. What this object is and how it is used will become clear\n",
    "in the next chapter. So, from the Python prompt:\n"
