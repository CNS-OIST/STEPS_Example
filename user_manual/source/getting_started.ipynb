    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this document is to get you started quickly with STEPS\n",
    "by working through a number of examples that highlight the various\n",
    "capabilities of this software package. However, before you can do\n",
    "that, you need to have a working copy of STEPS installed on your\n",
    "computer. So we will first explain the requirements of STEPS in terms\n",
    "of third party software and prior knowledge and then how to compile\n",
    "and install on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Image\n",
    "For user who want to quickly try STEPS without compilation from the source code,\n",
    "we provide a prebuilt Docker image of the latest release, which can be accessed via  \n",
    "[https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Docker](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install from source code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum Prerequisites\n",
    "1. C++ compiler supporting c++17 (e.g. gcc 7.4, clang 6)\n",
    "2. Python3 (3.6.x or above, 3.9.x or above if using stepsblender python package)\n",
    "3. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "4. [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n",
    "5. [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) (not installed by default on Mac, `brew install pkg-config` to install it)\n",
    "6. [Cython](http://www.cython.org/)\n",
    "7. BLAS/[OpenBLAS](http://www.openblas.net/)\n",
    "8. [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)\n",
    "9. [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)\n",
    "10. [METIS](https://github.com/KarypisLab/METIS)\n",
    "11. `build` and `pip-tools` python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Prerequisites\n",
    "1. To use the parallel SSA solver TetOpSplit:\n",
    "    - MPI libraries (e.g. [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) )\n",
    "    - [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    "2. To use the parallel EField solver: [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)\n",
    "3. To use the distributed mesh solver: [Omega_h](https://github.com/sandialabs/omega_h) (bundled with STEPS by default)\n",
    "4. To use data saving to HDF5 files: [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the use of a number of packages, namely NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib,\n",
    "Python can be made to resemble the Matlab environment for scientific computing\n",
    "rather closely. The NumPy package brings powerful array objects to Python.\n",
    "These array objects will typically rely on an optimized linear algebra package\n",
    "to make the operations on them very fast. SciPy builds on top of NumPy and adds\n",
    "even more functionality for signal processing, numerical integration, etc.\n",
    "Finally, Matplotlib adds a collection of powerful 2D plotting tools to your\n",
    "Python environment, that once again resemble the plotting commands familiar from Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "These add-on packages are in common use among the scientific computing community and\n",
    "it is highly recommended that two of these packages (NumPy and SciPy) are installed\n",
    "on your system. Although one could use STEPS without taking advantage of these packages,\n",
    "we highly recommend you do take the time to get acquainted with them as they will make it\n",
    "easier to run simulations, collect output and perform extra processing on this data. Starting\n",
    "from the very first example we will show how NumPy arrays can be used for these tasks rather\n",
    "than the basic built-in types in Python (lists, tuples etc), although one could replace a NumPy\n",
    "array with a list in the code, for example, if more comfortable with the built-in types.\n",
    "For further information on these packages you can visit the following online resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Documentation Link to NumPy and SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/Documentation)\n",
    "* [NumPy for Matlab users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html)\n",
    "* [A very good NumPy tutorial content-wise.](http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/HTML/numdoc.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining STEPS Source code\n",
    "\n",
    "STEPS 3.0.0 and above are available at [https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Old releases (STEPS 2.2.0 and below) can be downloaded at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/steps/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/steps/files/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install From Github Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how to compile and install STEPS on a generic Unix-like system, including Linux and MacOSX.\n",
    "Official support of Windows platform is discontinued.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New installation or upgrade from a STEPS version above 3.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "To **install STEPS from source code**, first clone the repository using the folowing command in terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If not already installed, install the `build` and `pip-tools` python modules\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --user build pip-tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then run the following commands to compile the source code and install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd STEPS\n",
    "git submodule update --init --recursive\n",
    "mkdir build\n",
    "cd build\n",
    "cmake ..\n",
    "make\n",
    "make install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, by default, STEPS will install its python dependencies during the call to `make install`, this can be prevented by setting the following cmake option:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cmake -DSTEPS_INSTALL_PYTHON_DEPS=False ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the installation location by changing the prefix in CMake:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/MY_INSTALL_LOCATION ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "MPI and PETSc libraries are automatically detected in the system. If the user\n",
    "wants to manually choose to build STEPS with / without them they can set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cmake -DUSE_MPI=[True|False] -DUSE_PETSC=[True|False] ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the distributed mesh solver DistTetOpSplit will be built. If the user wants to manually choose to build STEPS with / without this they can set:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cmake -DSTEPS_USE_DIST_MESH=[True|False] ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to [CMAKE documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for customizing your installation. Advanced installation customization and frequently encountered problems during installations are discussed in the [Customizing STEPS installation](customizing_install.rst) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can check the STEPS installation with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -c \"import steps; steps._greet()\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If STEPS is installed successfully, you should be able to see similar information as below:\n",

    "    CXX Binding: Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "Just about every task related to building a model, describing the geometry and\n",
    "running a simulation in STEPS involves creating **objects** in Python and utilising\n",
    "the object methods (so it is highly recommend that you are familiar with Python objects\n",
    "and comfortable using them, though you will gain more experience by working through the\n",
    "examples in this document). The class definitions for these objects reside in Python modules\n",
    "in the steps directory ([steps.model](API_2/API_model.rst), [steps.geom](API_2/API_geom.rst), [steps.sim](API_2/API_sim.rst) etc).\n",
    "So to test installation,\n",
    "try to create your first STEPS object. What this object is and how it is used will become clear\n",
    "in the next chapter. So, from the Python prompt:\n"

    "### Serial Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often more convenient to run STEPS simulation with pre-written Python scripts, which is the main focus of this manual.\n",
    "You can execute a simulation script in serial mode like this:\n",

    "mpirun -n <n_procs> python my_parallel_simulation.py\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Validation and Examples\n",
    "- Short validation tests (runnning in a few minutes) can be found in the release repository, under `test/validation` and can be run from the `build` directory with `ctest -R .*validation.*`\n",
    "- Longer validation tests (using serial and parallel solvers) can be found in the [STEPS_Validation](https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS_Validation) repository\n",
