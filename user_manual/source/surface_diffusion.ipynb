    "Solving STEPS models in CVODE\n",
    "requires supplying information of all the variables in a STEPS simulation at any time as a state vector to the CVODE solver. The variables in STEPS\n",
    "are the molecular species, which have unique populations in individual mesh elements (tetrahedrons and triangles) meaning that\n",
    "the state vector can be rather large (number_volume_specs*number_tetrahedrons + number_surface_specs*number_triangles). STEPS\n",
    "must also supply a function that describes the rate of change of each of these variables with time depending on other variables in the system. CVODE then finds\n",
    "approximate solutions (here STEPS choses the recommended Adams-Moulton formulas with functional iteration) when the system\n",
    "advances in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this it takes a number of 'steps', each time estimating the local error and comparing to tolerance conditions: if the\n",
    "test fails, step size is reduced, and this is repeated until tolerance conditions are met. This means that there is a tradeoff between accuracy\n",
    "and simulation speed- with a high tolerance, steps sizes will be large and few steps will have to be taken to advance the simulation some amount of time\n",
    "though accuracy will be low, with low tolerance, steps sizes will be small so a large number of steps will be taken to advance the simulation although\n",
    "accuracy will be high. Therefore, the tolerance is an important consideration both for accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "tolerance, and in STEPS both are scalars. Relative tolerance controls relative errors so that e.g. $10^{-3}$  means that errors are controlled to\n",
    "0.1% (and it is not recommended to go any higher than that). Absolute tolerances can be useful when any components of the vector approach very small numbers\n",
    "when relative error control becomes meaningless. The absolute values in the internal state vectors within TetODE are the (fractional) number\n",

    "within tetrahedrons and triangles will be accurate to within 1/1000th of a molecule! In TetODE only one value each for absolute tolerance and relative\n",

    "tolerance is $10^{-3}$ .\n",
